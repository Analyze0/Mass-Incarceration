      <p>60,000 youth children are sleeping behind bars each day in the U.S. This team called G.A.P, the gangs and prison prevention program are using men and women who were incarcerated to mentor the youth and how to stay out of trouble and away from prison. The United States incarcerates more of its youth than any other country in the world. African American youth was five times more likely to be detained than White youth according to research in 2015. Some youth that were in prison were sometimes sent to Rikers Island prison facility in New York and have to be in a cell with others that are twice or even three times your age and this is not that uncommon. There is a campaign called raise the age campaign making it where things like getting into fights at school don’t send you to prison or jail and to lower the harsh sentences and setting the right punishment for the age appropriate thing the child did.</p>

      <p>In a single year it is estimated that 2.1 million children under the age of 18 are arrested in the United states because of the school to prison pipeline. Students of color receive harsher punishments than their white peers. Black and Hispanic children cover more than 70 percent of those involved in school related arrests. African American children make up two fifths and Hispanics one fifth of confined youth today. According to recent data by the Department of Education African American were arrested for more than their white classmates. Youth that went to prison were 39%  less likely to finish high school than other kids who came from the same neighborhood. Even young offenders who weren’t imprisoned were better off, they were 13% more likely to finish high school than incarcerated children. Young offenders who were incarcerated were a staggering 67% more likely to be in jail again by the age of 25 than similar young offenders who didn’t go to jail.</p>
